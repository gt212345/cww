Cheng-Wen Wu received the BSEE degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1981, and the MS and PhD degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. Since 1988, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he is currently a Tsing Hua Chair Professor and Senior Vice President. He has served in the past as the Director of Computer and Communications Center, Director of Technology Service Center, Chair of EE Department, Director of IC Design Technology Center, and Dean of the College of EECS. He was on leave from NTHU, serving as the General Director of the SOC Technology Center (STC) at ITRI from 2007 to 2009. He subsequently orchestrated the merger of STC and the Information and Communications Research Laboratories (ICL), and served as the Vice President of ITRI and General Director of ICL. He is the Chair of the IC Design Committee, Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA), and on the board of Taiwan IC Design Society. He is also Chair of the Board of Governors, Hsinchu NTU Alumni Association.

Dr. Wu was the Technical Program Chair of the IEEE 5th Asian Test Symposium (ATS96), General Chair of ATS00, General Co-Chair of the IEEE Memory Technology, Design, and Testing Workshop (MTDT) in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009, Organizing Committee Chair of the IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuit Conference (A-SSCC) in 2009, General Co-Chair of the IEEE Int. Symp. on VLSI Design, Automation, and Test (VLSI-DAT) in 2008 and 2009, and General Chair of the IEEE IMS3TW in 2012. Dr. Wu was the Editor-in-Chief for the International Journal of Electrical Engineering (IJEE) and subsequently Chair of its Editorial Board. He is an Editor for the Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications (JETTA), an Editor for IEEE Design and Test of Computers, an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Computers, and an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on CAD.

In addition to a few best paper awards, Dr. Wu received the Distinguished Teaching Awards (twice) from NTHU, the Outstanding Electrical Engineering Professor Award from the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers (CIEE), the Distinguished Research Awards (three times) from National Science Council, the Industrial Collaboration Awards (twice) from the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Academic Award from MOE, the Continuous Service Award and Outstanding Contribution Award from the IEEE Computer Society, the IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) Best Innovative Practices Session Award from TTTC, IEEE Computer Society, the Distinguished Industrial Collaboration Award from NTHU, the National Invention Award (Silver Medal) from Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the TECO Award. He became a Golden Core Member of the IEEE Computer Society in 2006. In 2013, he received the National Endowed Chair Professorship from MOE. His research interests include design and test of high performance VLSI circuits and systems, and test and repair of semiconductor memory. He is a life member of the CIEE, a life member of Taiwan IC Design Society, and a Fellow of the IEEE.
